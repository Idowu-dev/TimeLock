## Security Considerations

   - Minimum lock period must be greater than 0

2. **Access Controls**
   - Only contract owner can perform emergency withdrawals
   - Only token owners can initiate standard withdrawals
   - Ownership transfers require current owner authorization

3. **Data Validation**
   - All inputs are validated before processing
   - Principal addresses checked for validity
   - Transfer operations verified for success
